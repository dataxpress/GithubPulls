GithubPulls
===========
A tool for watching sets of repos for open pull requests. There is a more up-to-date version of this, but it's in a private repo. Will link to it if it becomes public. In the mean time, you should also check out [Trailer](https://github.com/HouseTrip/trailer) - they achieved much of the functionality I was going for anyway, and is far more complete than this.
